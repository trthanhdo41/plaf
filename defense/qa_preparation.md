# Q&A Preparation: PhD Defense

## Anticipated Questions by Category

### Technical/Algorithmic Questions

#### Q1: Why CatBoost over other models?
**Answer**: CatBoost achieved the best performance on our dataset with AUC=0.983 and F1=0.781. Key advantages: (1) Excellent handling of categorical features natively without manual encoding, (2) Built-in class balancing for our imbalanced dataset, (3) Robust to overfitting with automatic regularization, (4) Compatible with SHAP TreeExplainer for interpretability. While XGBoost and Random Forest also performed well (AUC >0.97), CatBoost's combination of performance and interpretability made it the best choice for our educational context.

#### Q2: How does your cold-start handler differ from traditional approaches?
**Answer**: Traditional cold-start solutions use collaborative filtering or transfer learning, which require some overlap in features or courses. Our demographic K-NN approach works with only 6 demographic features available at enrollment: gender, region, education, IMD band, age, and disability. We use Euclidean distance to find k=10 most similar historical students, then weighted prediction based on inverse distance. This enables immediate intervention from day one, achieving 71.2% accuracy vs 50% baseline. The confidence scoring helps indicate prediction reliability.

#### Q3: Why FAISS for RAG instead of other vector databases?
**Answer**: We chose FAISS for several reasons: (1) Lightweight and CPU-compatible - no external server required, (2) Fast enough for our knowledge base size (<10k documents), (3) Free and open-source, (4) Easy integration with Python ML stack. Alternatives like Pinecone or Weaviate would be overkill for our educational content and introduce unnecessary complexity. For production systems with >1M documents, we'd consider more scalable solutions, but FAISS meets our current needs perfectly.

#### Q4: How do you ensure DiCE counterfactuals are realistic?
**Answer**: We implement feasibility constraints in the config file. Immutable features (gender, region, age) cannot be changed. For actionable features, we set realistic multipliers: assessment scores can only increase (1.0-1.5x), VLE clicks can increase up to 2x, papers failed can reduce to 0. We also use diversity weighting to generate multiple pathways to success. The 94.2% success rate shows most counterfactuals are feasible. We validate this by showing examples to educators who confirm the recommendations are actionable.

#### Q5: What are limitations of SHAP for tree ensembles?
**Answer**: SHAP has several limitations: (1) Computational cost O(TLDÂ²) where T=trees, L=leaves, D=depth - we use sampling to manage this, (2) Requires background data for comparison - we use stratified samples, (3) Approximations for large feature spaces - we limit to top 25 features, (4) Doesn't capture feature interactions well - that's why we complement with DiCE. Despite limitations, SHAP provides the best balance of accuracy and interpretability for our ensemble models.

#### Q6: Why not use deep learning for sequential student behavior?
**Answer**: We considered LSTMs/RNNs for temporal patterns but chose ensemble methods for several reasons: (1) Interpretability - educational contexts require explainable decisions, (2) Data size - 32K students may not be enough for deep learning, (3) Feature engineering - we have rich engineered features that work well with tree models, (4) Computational efficiency - faster training and inference. However, deep learning would be valuable for larger datasets with more temporal data. This is a future research direction.

### System Design Questions

#### Q7: Why separate student and advisor interfaces?
**Answer**: Different user needs require different interfaces. Students need: simple risk visualization, course materials, conversational chatbot. Advisors need: bulk student monitoring, detailed analytics, intervention planning tools. The separation also addresses privacy - students see only their data, advisors see aggregated views. Role-based access ensures appropriate data sharing. The dual interface design allows each user type to focus on their primary tasks without interface clutter.

#### Q8: How does your system scale to millions of students?
**Answer**: Several scalability considerations: (1) Batch prediction - ML models run offline, only inference is real-time, (2) Database optimization - SQLite works for our prototype, production would use PostgreSQL with indexing, (3) FAISS index sharding for large knowledge bases, (4) Async chatbot processing with queue systems, (5) Caching frequently accessed data. For institutions with >100K students, we'd implement distributed processing and microservices architecture. The current system handles 32K students comfortably.

#### Q9: What happens if Gemini API fails?
**Answer**: We implement graceful degradation: (1) Retry logic with exponential backoff, (2) Fallback to template-based responses using retrieved context, (3) Queue system to handle API rate limits, (4) Local caching of common responses. In worst case, the system falls back to showing SHAP explanations and DiCE counterfactuals without LLM-generated advice. The core prediction and explanation features work offline. We also monitor API usage and costs.

#### Q10: How do you handle real-time predictions?
**Answer**: Real-time predictions work through: (1) Pre-trained models loaded in memory (<100ms inference), (2) Feature computation pipeline that updates student profiles as new data arrives, (3) Incremental updates rather than full retraining, (4) Caching of computed features. The system can handle hundreds of concurrent predictions. For true real-time (sub-second), we'd implement model serving with TensorFlow Serving or similar.

### Educational/Evaluation Questions

#### Q11: How do you validate intervention effectiveness?
**Answer**: This is a key limitation of our current work. We measure: (1) Advice quality scores (0.842 overall), (2) User satisfaction (78% helpful, 84% would use again), (3) Engagement metrics (chat frequency, time spent). However, we lack longitudinal data showing actual grade improvements or dropout prevention. Future work needs randomized controlled trials comparing AI vs human advising over full semesters. This would require institutional partnerships and IRB approval.

#### Q12: What evidence shows chatbot is better than email/advisor?
**Answer**: We compare: (1) Response time - AI: 1.279s vs human: hours/days, (2) Availability - AI: 24/7 vs human: 9-5, (3) Consistency - AI: standardized quality vs human: varies by advisor experience, (4) Cost - AI: ~$50/month vs human: $60K/year salary. However, we acknowledge AI can't replace human empathy for complex situations. The system is designed to augment, not replace, human advisors. Mixed-methods studies would better evaluate effectiveness.

#### Q13: How do you measure "empathy" in chatbot responses?
**Answer**: We use several approaches: (1) Sentiment analysis of responses (positive tone: 82%), (2) Growth mindset language detection (76%), (3) User surveys rating empathy (qualitative feedback), (4) A/B testing with/without empathetic language. However, measuring empathy is inherently subjective. We focus on actionable, encouraging advice rather than emotional mimicry. The 0.798 encouragement score indicates we're achieving this balance.

#### Q14: Can students game the system to appear lower risk?
**Answer**: Several safeguards: (1) Immutable features (demographics) can't be faked, (2) Longitudinal tracking detects sudden behavior changes, (3) Anomaly detection flags suspicious patterns, (4) Multiple behavioral indicators prevent single-metric gaming. However, if students genuinely improve their engagement and grades, that's the desired outcome. The system should encourage positive behavior changes. We monitor for gaming patterns and can adjust models accordingly.

### Ethical/Privacy Questions

#### Q15: How do you handle algorithmic bias?
**Answer**: Several mitigation strategies: (1) Feature importance analysis shows demographics contribute <15% to predictions, (2) Regular bias auditing across demographic groups, (3) Fairness constraints in model training, (4) Diverse training data from multiple student populations. We acknowledge bias is a ongoing challenge requiring continuous monitoring. Future work includes bias mitigation techniques like adversarial debiasing and fair representation learning.

#### Q16: What if students don't consent to tracking?
**Answer**: We implement opt-in consent with clear explanation of data usage. Students can: (1) Opt out of AI monitoring while keeping basic LMS access, (2) Access their risk predictions and explanations, (3) Request data deletion, (4) Choose human advisor instead of AI. We comply with GDPR/FERPA requirements. The system is designed to help, not surveil - transparency about benefits is key to consent.

#### Q17: Who has access to student risk predictions?
**Answer**: Role-based access control: (1) Students see only their own data, (2) Advisors see students in their courses/programs, (3) Administrators see aggregated statistics, (4) No individual predictions shared outside institution. All access is logged and auditable. Students can request explanation of any prediction. We're developing "right to explanation" procedures for disputed predictions.

#### Q18: Could this create self-fulfilling prophecies?
**Answer**: This is a valid concern. We mitigate by: (1) Framing predictions as "support opportunities" not "failure predictions", (2) Focus on growth mindset and actionable improvements, (3) Show students how to improve rather than just flagging problems, (4) Train advisors to use predictions constructively. The goal is empowerment, not labeling. We monitor for negative psychological effects and adjust messaging accordingly.

### Comparison/Related Work Questions

#### Q19: How does this differ from commercial LA tools (Brightspace, Canvas)?
**Answer**: Key differences: (1) Open-source vs proprietary, (2) Prescriptive focus vs descriptive/diagnostic, (3) RAG chatbot for automated intervention vs manual advisor review, (4) Research-driven vs product-driven development, (5) Complete pipeline vs point solutions. Commercial tools typically stop at dashboards - we close the loop with automated intervention. Our system is designed for research and can be customized, while commercial tools are one-size-fits-all.

#### Q20: What's novel beyond Susnjak's PLAF framework?
**Answer**: Susnjak proposed the conceptual framework but didn't implement it. Our innovations: (1) Complete 8-stage pipeline implementation, (2) RAG chatbot for automated intervention (not in original framework), (3) Cold-start handler for new students, (4) Multi-level XAI integration, (5) Dual-interface design, (6) Comprehensive evaluation on real dataset. We validate the framework while extending it with practical innovations.

#### Q21: Why not use ChatGPT/GPT-4 instead of Gemini?
**Answer**: Cost and performance considerations: (1) Gemini 2.5 Flash costs ~$0.075/1M tokens vs GPT-4 $30/1M tokens (400x difference), (2) Faster inference (~1s vs 2-3s), (3) Good quality for educational advice, (4) Research partnership potential. GPT-4 might have slightly better quality but cost makes it impractical for institutional deployment. We evaluated both and found Gemini sufficient for our use case.

### Technical Deep Dive Questions

#### Q22: How do you handle class imbalance in the dataset?
**Answer**: Multiple strategies: (1) Stratified sampling in train/test splits, (2) Class weights in all models ('balanced' parameter), (3) F1-score as primary metric (balances precision/recall), (4) SMOTE oversampling if needed (though class weights worked well), (5) AUC metric less sensitive to imbalance. The ~30/70 at-risk/safe split is manageable with these techniques. We monitor performance across both classes.

#### Q23: What's your feature selection strategy?
**Answer**: We use all 25 engineered features rather than selection because: (1) Tree models handle irrelevant features well, (2) Domain expertise guided feature creation, (3) SHAP importance shows which features matter, (4) Small feature set (25) doesn't cause overfitting. We did try feature selection but it didn't improve performance. The engineered features capture different aspects of student behavior effectively.

#### Q24: How do you validate the RAG knowledge base quality?
**Answer**: Several validation approaches: (1) Domain expert review of knowledge base content, (2) Relevance scoring on test queries (0.825 average), (3) User feedback on response quality, (4) A/B testing with/without retrieved context. We continuously update the knowledge base based on user feedback and new course materials. The grounding in verified educational content is key to response quality.

### Future Work Questions

#### Q25: What's your plan for multi-institutional validation?
**Answer**: Future research directions: (1) Partner with 3-5 diverse institutions, (2) Federated learning approach for privacy-preserving model training, (3) Cross-institutional validation studies, (4) Generalization analysis across different student populations. This would require significant resources and institutional partnerships. The open-source nature facilitates this collaboration.

#### Q26: How would you handle different cultural contexts?
**Answer**: Several considerations: (1) Localize knowledge base content, (2) Adapt demographic features to local context, (3) Cultural sensitivity in chatbot responses, (4) Different educational system structures. This requires extensive validation and cultural expertise. We'd start with English-speaking institutions with similar educational structures before expanding globally.
